# Remix Router + Angular

This is a working example of routing with @remix-run/router in Angular. It uses Angular's new standalone features for components, pipes, and directives. It also uses the new `inject()` function for using DI without explicit an explicit constructor.

## Setup

Install dependencies

```sh
yarn
```

## Serve application

Run the `dev` command to serve the application

```sh
yarn dev
```

Navigate to http://localhost:4200 in your browser
